    <h2>Introduction</h2>
</header>
<p>The main goal of this guide is to help developers on common simple and complex use cases developing an application with Angular.</p>
<p>Is a <strong>very opinionated guide</strong> about best practices and the aim is at high level. This isn't a <em>from zero guide</em> nor an <em>API Reference</em>. <a href="https://angular.io" target="_blank">Official Angular documentation</a> will be referenced in such cases when some basic knowledge is needed.</p>

    <h3>About Angular</h3>
    <p>Angular is a web application develoment framework to be used for the Front-End. It was developed to run on Javascript. However it's desgined to be used in Typescript, and transpiled to Javascript or other targets.</p>
    
    <p>
        I say that it is a Web <strong>Application</strong> Framework for a reason.
            If you want to create a mockup, a static website or a small app (small enough to be only maintained by you)
            Angular will be an overkill and there are other frameworks out there that may fit your needs more accurately (like React for example).
    </p>
    <h4>Web Components vs Web Applications</h4>
    <p>
        Other frameworks like <strong>React</strong> are <em>Web Component Frameworks</em>, but <strong>Angular is a Web Application framework</strong> 
        because it comes with a sort of other tools (and opinions) that go far beyond Web Components.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ok, Angular helps creating components, but:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can't render a component outside Angular (before Ivy). <em>There is Angular Elements, but it still works inside Angular</em></li>
        <li>It does a LOT of more things for you: building proccess handling, bundling, routing, lazy loading, platform agnostic rendering, tooling for state management, i18n handling, component prototyping</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, we can say that Angular is a Web Component framework, <strong>but it also adds a lot of functionality that you are going to need for developing a full Web Application.</strong></p>
    <p>In the end, if your application is big and serious enough, you are going to need this kind of tools. <strong>The difference is Angular has <em>made</em> the decision for you already.</strong></p>
    <p>React for example started as a simple library for Front-End components, but now you can find a lot of tools in the React environment that suit the roles of the rest of parts of Angular (because in the end, you are going to need them).</p>

    <p>That is why I say that Angular (as this guide) is very opinionated. You can review and decide what tool or strategy use for each situation and edge case, or go ahead with the solution more experienced developers proposed</p>
    <p>This, however, isn't always a pro. Sometimes we need something more specific or handmade tailored.</p>
    
    <p>Anyway, everything can be changed. The Angular team deeply though about it and they improve the framework with each release, so everything is abstracted enough to be replaced with custom parts when needed.</p>

    <h4>What's inside Angular?</h4>
    <p>So, let's take a quick look to what comes with Angular:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Angular CLI</li>
        <li>ngc - Ng Compiler (a wrapper around Typescript Compiler)</li>
        <li>Webpack - Bundler</li>
        <li>Zone.js - Asynchronus abstraction layer (asynchronus context provider, change detection, error handling)</li>
        <li>RxJS - Observer pattern library/framework</li>
        <li>Karma - Test runner</li>
        <li>The Angular Core - Renderer2 and rest of abstractions</li>
        <li>WIP?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Angular Core it's Angular itself, and it relays on RxJS for every reactive interaction, but besides that, any other part of the package could be changed to another tool.</p>
